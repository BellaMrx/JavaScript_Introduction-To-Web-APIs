# 1. Video and audio media API
Playing video and audio files is possible in HTML5 with the `<video>` and `<audio>` elements. The appearance of the controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) are predefined by the web browser and cannot be changed. But it is also possible to control media files using the JavaScript API. The advantage of custom controls for playing media files using the Media API is that the design and functionality of the player can be determined by the user and the controls can be styled using CSS or graphics.

The Media API provides a fairly large set of properties and methods. Furthermore, many event types are available, which can be used to react accordingly. 

A complete overview of all media events can be found here [HTML - Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#mediaevents).
